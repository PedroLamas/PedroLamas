Hi! I'm Pedro! I'm a Software Development Consultant, I like to code a lot of stuff!

I'm particularly interested in Windows Development, but lately I've been playing a lot with React and Typescript!

You can find me on [@pedrolamas](https://twitter.com/pedrolamas) and my blog at [www.pedrolamas.com](https://www.pedrolamas.com)!
